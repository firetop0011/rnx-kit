It is focused on\\ndeveloper experience, and designed to fit into projects of all shapes and sizes.\\n\\nWe know that great tools make all the difference.\\n\\n## Community First\\n\\nWe created this as a GitHub-first repository for the React Native community. The\\ntools in this project integrate with tools you already use: Metro, TypeScript,\\nJest, and more.\\n\\nYour contributions are always welcome! The more this project grows, the more it\\nwill help the React Native community.\\n\\nA rising tide lifts all boats.\\n\\n## Tested at Scale, Supported by Microsoft\\n\\nFrom unit tests to deployments in large monorepos, each tool is thoroughly\\nvalidated. Microsoft has engineers dedicated to this project, using it to ship\\nReact Native apps to millions of customers.\\n\\nThe tools here are used in Office, Xbox, Teams, and other product groups.\\n\\n## Ready to Go?\\n\\nJump in with the [Getting Started](/docs/guides/getting-started) guide, or take\\nit a bit slower and read the [Introduction](/docs/introduction) first."}]}')}}]);
